		desc: 'React Native is a Javascript library created by Facebook. It is used to develop applications for systems Android and iOS natively.\nIn 2012 Mark Zuckerberg commented, "The biggest mistake we made as a company was betting too much on HTML5 as opposed to the native one". He promised that Facebook would soon deliver a better mobile experience.\nWithin Facebook, Jordan Walke found a way to generate user interface elements for iOS from a thread JavaScript in the background. They decided to organize a Hackathon to perfect this prototype to be able to create native applications with this technology\nAfter months of development, Facebook launched the first version of React in 2015. During a technical lecture, Christopher Chedeau explained that Facebook was already using React Native in production.\nThe operating principles of React Native are virtually identical to the ReactJs, except that React Native does not manipulate DOM through Virtual DOM. It runs in a background process ( that interprets JavaScript written by developers ) directly on the final device and communicates with the native platform through serialization, an asynchronous and batch bridge.\nReact Native does not use HTML. Instead, it works with pure Javascript with JSX syntax.',
